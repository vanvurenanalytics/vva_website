About Us
===================

At Van Vuren Analytics we provide advisory services in transport planning, modelling and analytics.  
Over the past 40 years we have advised local, regional, and national governments on the models and analyses 
that underpin the decision-making for their transport plans, policies and projects across all modes.

We have developed best practice guidance in transport modelling and analysis in the UK and Australia. 
We walk the talk – at Van Vuren Analytics we have developed, maintained, enhanced and used transport 
models at local, metropolitan urban and national level.

Our greatest strength and value is in being able to find pragmatic and defensible solutions, building 
on our extensive international experience, and always referring back to our academic roots and insisting 
on an objective and broad evidence base.
